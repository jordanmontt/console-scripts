# console-scripts

Useful that I use in my zsh terminal. For using the Pharo scripts, you need to install [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf). Also if you want the theme and the autocompletion, you need to clone the repositories inside `.zsh/plugins`. The link is in a comment.

It assumes that you have your files inside a `~/.zsh/` folder.

```
~/.zsh/
|    themes/
     |     spaceship-prompt
|    plugins/
     |    zsh-autosuggestions
|    .zsh_history
|    .zshrc
```

For creating a link to point to the `.zsh/.zshrc` file

```bash
~ ln -s .zsh/.zshrc .zshrc
```
